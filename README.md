- 👋 Hi, I’m @Preteck
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code for a bit of side fun really, I always have ideas but never execute them, maybe this is a step to doing something interesting with my life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript (React/NodeJS) and Python with a sprinkling of deep learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, don't think I'm good enough for a collaboration yet!
- 📫 How to reach me... probably through this website?
